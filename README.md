## Inspiration
TerraFit, a clever play on the word "terrific," is born from a passion to inspire self-confidence among gym-goers. Recognizing the common struggles of feeling unsure or lacking guidance during workouts, the TerraFit team embarked on a mission to provide users with more than just instructions. While existing apps offer workout routines and interaction with trainers, they often fall short in terms of affordability, accessibility, and the timely communication of exercises. Drawing inspiration from these pain points, TerraFit aspires to create a more enjoyable and empowering fitness journey.
## What it does
TerraFit is a *terrific*, evolutionary fitness app that leverages innovative features. Users can scan or manually input gym equipment available to them, ensuring accessibility and adaptability to various workout environments. Furthermore, the app offers a post-workout feedback form and a platform for users to upload videos for form checks, promoting improvement and accountability.
## How we built it
1. *Brainstorm Ideas*: 
We kicked off our journey with an extensive brainstorming session. During this creative process, we explored various concepts and ideas, eventually refining them to shape the core vision of TerraFit.

2. *Team Collaboration*: Our team is a diverse mix of individuals with different backgrounds and skill sets, which we leveraged to our advantage. We recognized the unique strengths each team member brought to the table.

3. *Backend and Frontend development*: Keagan, our resident tech expert, took charge of the backend and frontend development. His expertise was instrumental in bringing the core functionalities of TerraFit to life.

4. *UI/UX Mastery*: Aman, our UI/UX maestro, played a pivotal role in crafting the user experience. He meticulously designed Figma wireframes to visualize and communicate our app's vision.

5. *Content Creation and Learning*: Aarthi and Kevin helped create a mini database of workouts. Aarthi focused on creating engaging, captivating content on the app screen. Meanwhile, Kevin took charge of video editing, breathing life into TerraFit's concept and vision through compelling visual content.

Through these efforts, we have webpages up until the customized workout plans, Figma and video trailer deliverables.
## Challenges we ran into

Navigating a steep learning curve was indeed a notable aspect of our journey in building TerraFit. Many of our team members were relatively new to the technical intricacies of app development, which made embracing these challenges all the more significant. Our commitment to mastering new technologies and coding languages demonstrated our dedication to the project's success. We thrived on the opportunity to learn and grow.

As first-time participants in a major hackathon, we encountered uncertainty and the unknown, yet these experiences ultimately strengthened our team and bolstered our confidence. We believe in the unique potential of TerraFit to stand out from existing fitness apps. Our core mission revolves around enhancing the confidence of aspiring and seasoned fitness enthusiasts and improving accessibility. This commitment is evident in the distinctive features showcased in our wireframes, such as the "scan your gym" and "check your form" functionalities. However, we were unable to implement these features as we are still waiting for the GPT image API. We view these challenges as opportunities and possibilities so we are excited to work on these after the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our proudest achievement is designing TerraFit as a comprehensive solution to make health and fitness accessible, convenient, and comfortable for all. Each team member played a crucial role in contributing to our shared goal. We are also really proud that we have created something that we all genuinely believe in and are hopeful that this is the first step to addressing the challenges brought about by the plethora of fitness apps. Our commitment to enhancing accessibility, confidence, and convenience in the fitness world is what drives us. 
Additionally, we embarked on a valuable learning journey throughout the development of TerraFit. Some of our team members, who didn't have prior backgrounds in software development, acquired fundamental knowledge in frontend development. This newfound understanding allowed us to contribute effectively to the project's success, demonstrating our commitment to personal growth and skill development. Our collective willingness to expand our horizons was a crucial aspect of our journey.
## What we learned
In the crucible of our hackathon experience, we unearthed the priceless gems of perseverance and the indomitable spirit of teamwork. Our journey was nothing short of remarkable, as we forged an unbreakable bond while sharing every momentâ€”whether it was devouring late-night pizza, nodding off to sleep, burning the midnight oil in intense work sessions, or eagerly participating in enlightening workshops.

Astonishingly, despite hailing from diverse backgrounds and being relative strangers at the start, we seamlessly gelled into a harmonious team. The magic lay in our shared purpose and relentless drive, transcending the barriers of familiarity. Our journey was a testament to the incredible power of unity, which not only helped us conquer technical challenges but also formed the bedrock of lasting friendships and unforgettable memories.

## What's next for TerraFit
Our next steps involve eagerly awaiting the integration of the GPT extension, which will enable groundbreaking functionalities like equipment scanning and form checks. While we've thoughtfully incorporated these features into our wireframes, we're excited to bring them to life after the hackathon. Stay tuned for an even more remarkable journey!
